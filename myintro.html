<p>
Hi, I am Samuel Dass and am from India. I completed my Bachelors of Engineering in 2018 in Electronics and Telecommunication majors. <br> Then I have started working for Amazon. I was hired initially into credit risk management where my job was to manage customer accounts and orders and later I got moved into business operations role, where I used to work on launching products into Amazon marketplaces across the world from different sellers. Apart from this in collaboration with international Tech teams, we used to work on projects that would make the process automate. Being a part of business team, I just know how management works but I was not into programming. Then I have developed my interest to learn skills that would help me in progress with the current technologies being used into the business and so did I choose to pursue my Masters in MIS program.
